    <h2>About PAKDD-GLFM 2025</h2>
    <p>                
        In <strong>PAKDD-GLFM 2025 (Workshop on Graph Learning with Foundation Models @ PAKDD 2025)</strong>, we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss and advance the state-of-the-art in graph machine learning with foundation models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) represent a cutting-edge approach in graph machine learning that integrates the power of large-scale foundation models with graph structures.
        Specifically, GFMs are designed to effectively capture complex relationships and dependencies present in graph-structured data, such as social networks, biological networks, and knowledge graphs.
        By learning from diverse and extensive graph data, GFMs show emergent capabilities that significantly enhance performance across various, even unseen, downstream tasks, such as node/graph classification and 
        link prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
        As graphs continue to be a powerful tool for modeling real-world interactions, the development of GFMs is becoming increasingly important with real-world applications spanning diverse fields, including detecting anomalies in social networks, drug discovery through graph-based molecular classification, enhancing recommendation systems for personalized content, and strengthening cybersecurity by identifying vulnerabilities in network structures.
        Again, the emergent capabilities of GFMs allow them to adapt to new applications, generalizing across diverse domains and uncovering insights beyond the reach of traditional models.
