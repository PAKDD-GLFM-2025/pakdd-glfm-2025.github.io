    <h2>About PAKDD-GLFM 2025</h2>
    <p>                
        In <strong>PAKDD-GLFM 2025 (Workshop on Graph Learning with Foundation Models @ PAKDD 2025)</strong>, we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss and advance the state-of-the-art in graph machine learning with foundation models.
        <!-- \smallsection{Objectives.}
The primary objectives of the workshop are to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Facilitate discussions on the latest advancements in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), enabling researchers to exchange ideas and insights on state-of-the-art techniques and applications of GFMs.
    \item Foster collaboration between academia, industry, and practitioners by providing a platform to present novel methodologies, datasets, and real-world use cases involving GFMs.
    \item Encourage the exploration of emerging challenges and opportunities in leveraging graph structures to advance the capabilities of foundation models, particularly in areas such as scalability, model interpretability, efficient training on large-scale datasets, domain adaptation, and multi-modal learning.
\end{enumerate}


\smallsection{Scope.}
The scope of this workshop includes (but is not limited to):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Theoretical foundation of GFMs.}
    For example, the theoretical understanding of the GFMs' ability to generalize to unseen data and tasks, and to remain resilient to noise and adversarial perturbations.
    \item \textbf{Empirical analysis of GFMs.}
    For example, the empirical evaluation of GFMs across different tasks and datasets, as well as identifying their limitations, such as scalability challenges and sensitivity to noise.
    \item \textbf{Large-scale and efficient pre-training for GFMs.} For example, techniques to reduce the computational costs of GFMs while maintaining performance across diverse applications.
    \item \textbf{Fine-tuning and test-time adaptation for GFMs.} For example, techniques for adjusting model parameters during fine-tuning to improve performance on target datasets and tasks.
    \item \textbf{Multi-modality in graph tasks.}
    For example, techniques for integrating multi-modal data (e.g., text, images, or sensory data) in graph tasks.
    \item \textbf{New applications of GFMs.} For example, the applications of GFMs to unexplored real-world applications by leveraging their emergent capabilities.
