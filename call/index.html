    <h2>Call For Papers</h2>
    <p>
        In <strong>PAKDD-GLFM 2025 (Workshop on Graph Learning with Foundation Models @ <a href="https://pakdd2025.org/" target="_blank">PAKDD 2025</a>)</strong>, we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss and advance the state-of-the-art in graph machine learning with foundation models.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>scope</strong> of this workshop includes (but is not limited to):
    </p>
    <!-- <ul class="custom-bullets"> -->
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Theoretical foundation of GFMs:</strong> Theoretical understanding of the GFMs' ability to generalize to unseen data and tasks, and remain resilient to noise and adversarial perturbations.</li>
        <li><strong>Empirical analysis of GFMs:</strong> Evaluation of GFMs across different tasks and datasets, identifying limitations such as scalability challenges and sensitivity to noise.</li>
        <li><strong>Large-scale and efficient pre-training for GFMs:</strong> Techniques to reduce the computational costs of GFMs while maintaining performance across diverse applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Fine-tuning and test-time adaptation for GFMs:</strong> Techniques for adjusting model parameters during fine-tuning to improve performance on target datasets and tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-modality in graph tasks:</strong> Techniques for integrating multi-modal data (e.g., text, images, or sensory data) in graph tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>New applications of GFMs:</strong> Exploring applications of GFMs in real-world scenarios by leveraging their emergent capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
